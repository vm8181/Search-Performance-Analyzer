### Brand Share & Rank Analysis Queries
- Dataset: share_of_search (E-commerce Keyword Performance)
- Description:
  This file includes SQL Server queries for analyzing brand vs competitor performance on keyword-based product listings across e-commerce platforms.
---
### Sections Included:
1. Brand Share % by Keyword and Date
2. Brand vs Competitor Count in Top 10
3. Brand Share Trend over Time (Daily/Weekly/Monthly)
4. Product Avg Rank by Keyword Type
5. Platform-wise Brand Share per Keyword Type
6. Platform-wise Keyword Performance
7. Product Frequency in Top 3, Top 5, Top 10 (Weekly)
---
### Usage:
- Edit the date range dynamically using DATEADD or replace with a fixed date.
- For temporal trend queries, set @aggregation_level to 'Daily', 'Weekly', or 'Monthly'.
- Use in conjunction with Power BI for visual analytics.
---
### Dependencies:
- Table: share_of_search
- Columns: date, keywords, platform, rank, sponsered, brand_num, Keyword_type, pname, brands
- Ensure proper CAST(rank AS INT) where applicable.

## 1. What percentage of total results for a keyword are brand-owned products?
```sql
SELECT 
    date,
    keywords,
    STR(
        COUNT(CASE WHEN brand_num = 1 THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 
        6, 2
    ) AS brand_share_percent
FROM share_of_search
WHERE date >= DATEADD(DAY, -7, (SELECT MAX([date]) FROM share_of_search))
GROUP BY date, keywords
ORDER BY date DESC, keywords;
```
## 2. Among top 10 ranked items for each keyword, how many belong to the brand vs competitors?
```sql
SELECT 
    date,
    Keyword_type,
    keywords,

    COUNT(CASE WHEN brand_num = 0 THEN 1 END) AS comp_count_top_10
FROM share_of_search
WHERE CAST(rank AS INT) <= 10 AND date >= DATEADD(DAY, -7, (SELECT MAX([date]) FROM share_of_search))
GROUP BY date, keywords, Keyword_type
ORDER BY Keyword_type ASC, date DESC;
```
## 3. How does this trend over time? (Brand Share in Top 10)

            WHEN @aggregation_level = 'Monthly' THEN DATEFROMPARTS(YEAR([date]), MONTH([date]), 1)
        END AS period,
        DATEPART(MONTH, [date]) AS month_num,
        DATEPART(WEEK, [date]) - DATEPART(WEEK, DATEFROMPARTS(YEAR([date]), MONTH([date]), 1)) + 1 AS week_in_month,

        CAST(rank AS INT) AS rank
    FROM share_of_search
)
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN @aggregation_level = 'Monthly' THEN FORMAT(period, 'MMM-yyyy')

        ELSE FORMAT(period, 'yyyy-MM-dd')
    END AS display_period,
    period AS original_period,
    CAST(COUNT(CASE WHEN brand_num = 1 AND rank <= 10 THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / NULLIF(COUNT(CASE WHEN rank <= 10 THEN 1 END), 0) AS DECIMAL(5,2)) AS top_10_brand_share_percent
